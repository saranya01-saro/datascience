graduate admission prediction
Nowadays, the decision of whether getting admission in an institution is not predictable even sometimes the good guide may fail to predict. Hence in this paper, we apply a machine learning algorithm called logistic regression to predict whether a student will get a master degree admission in an institution or not. This will help the students to know whether they have a chance of admission in an institution and also the institution can also make decisions to whom they should give admission.
